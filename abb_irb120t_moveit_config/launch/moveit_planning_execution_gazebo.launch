  <!-- The planning and execution components of MoveIt! configured to run
       against a Gazebo based, ros_control compatible simulation of the IRB 120T.

       This depends on the corresponding 'abb_irb120_gazebo' pkg to be installed
       first. This dependency is not expressed in the MoveIt config pkg manifest,
       as adding a run_depend there would cause Gazebo to be unconditionally
       installed, even if the user never intends to use the MoveIt config with it.

       Instead, installation is left to the user, as a kind of poor-mans optional
       dependency.

       Finally, these launch files start everything: Gazebo, MoveIt, RViz. They
       also perform all required steps to configure intermediary and required
       nodes, and present the user with a plan-ready RViz session out-of-the-box.

       More advanced users may wish to separate some of the included launch files
       out into individual steps, so as to improve modularity of the (runtime)
       system.
